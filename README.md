# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Foxplayer (Music Streaming Web App)

## Overview

This project is a **Music Streaming Web App**, developed as part of my portfolio to showcase my skills in React and web development.

## Running the Project Locally

Since an API has not yet been integrated, the app currently operates without backend functionality. You can still explore the front-end interface by following these steps:

### Prerequisites:
- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

### Steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
5. Open your browser and navigate to the server address displayed in your terminal, typically:
   ```
   http://localhost:5173
   ```

## Known Limitations
- No backend/API integration currently exists, so data persistence and advanced features are unavailable.
- Some features listed in "Features in Progress" are placeholders for future functionality.

---

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with a music API for real-time data.
- Advanced user interactions, such as liking songs and sharing playlists.
- Dark mode toggle for user preferences.
