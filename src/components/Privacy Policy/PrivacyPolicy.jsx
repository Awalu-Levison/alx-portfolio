      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>Your privacy is important to us at Foxplayer. This policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your personal information.</p>

      <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        We collect information you provide directly to us, such as your name, email address, and usage data to enhance your experience
        on our platform.
      </p>

      <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
      <p>
        We use the information to provide, maintain, and improve our services. Additionally, we may use your email for newsletters
        and updates, with your consent.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Sharing of Information</h2>
      <p>We do not share your personal information with third parties except as required by law or with your explicit consent.</p>

      <h2>4. Cookies</h2>
      <p>
        Our website uses cookies to enhance user experience and track user behavior. You can control cookies through your browser
        settings.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
      <p>
        We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your data. However, no system is completely secure, so we cannot
        guarantee absolute security.

      <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>

        We may update this privacy policy periodically. Updates will be posted on this page, and we encourage you to review it
